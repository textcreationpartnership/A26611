         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if otherwiſe, it may be doubted, but however my truſt ſhall be in the Lord, And whereas it was your deſire, for me to declare what mercy and pity, I would ſhould be ſhown towards thoſe who are my manifeſt enemies. In caſe I ſhould come quietly to be reſtored to my three Kingdomes; I do therefore for the ſatisfaction both of You and my Subjects, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the thoughts of my heart, touching my ſaid enemies in manner following. That as for all ſuch, who ſhall humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves unto me, and expreſſing their Sorrow for all their former actings againſt Me and my late Father, and upon promiſe of their future obedience, I will freely pardon them of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107979:5"/>their lives; and as for their eſtates, thoſe who have lawfully purchaſed any from any of my Subjects; I will that they enjoy ſuch their eſtates according to their purchaſe, they only paying (for the ſpace of five years) the moiety of the profits of ſuch their eſtates towards ſatisfaction of the publick debts, that my poor Subjects may be ſomewhat eaſed of their Taxes, which have been ſo heavily impoſed upon them for this many years. And as for ſuch who have gotten or purchaſed by any means whatſoever any of my land (to wit) any of the Kings lands or livings, or the lands and livings of the Biſhops, late Deans and Chapiters, or of any of my Subjects, ſequeſtred or taken from them for their Delinquency (ſo accounted:) My will is, that ſuch eſtates ſo gotten, ſhall be by them ſurrendred into the hands and poſſeſſion of the right owners as formerly, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to reſt quiet &amp; ſatisfied with the gain and profit they have recieved thereby for the time paſt, and to loſe the profit for the time to come, which my conſcience tells me, is but plain reaſon; and as for thoſe who ſhall perſiſt and continue in their rebellion againſt me, I ſhall deſire, that ſuch courſe may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with them, as my Parliament and Councel ſhall think fit, and their eſtates to be diſpoſed of towards payment of the Publick debts which ſhall be judged neceſſary, and fit to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, which I ſhall refer to my Parliament and Councel; who I ſhall humbly deſire, and I queſtion not, but it will be their care, in being ſparing in ſpilling as little blood as may be. And as for the poor Common ſoldiers, they who will ſubmit themſelves to me, I freely pardon them; and my will is, that their Arrears ſhall be payed as ſpeedily as conveniently may be, although it be for their Service in fighting againſt me; but I impute all to their neceſſity; What I have here above declared, I ſhall labour to make good, to the utmoſt of my power. I ſhall not, neither do I in the leaſt, queſtion your Reality, in the faithful performance of what you have declared. God proſper you in all your undertakings therein; and I ſhall own you in every thing that you ſhall act, for Gods glory, and the good of my people, which I deſire may be done with as much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as may be. I render you very many thanks for your Love.</p>
